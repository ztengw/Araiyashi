## About
A ghost story that circles around a job in Japan/ Taiwan where people live in accident property (事故物件 / jikobukken: a property where a death, suicide, or crime has happened). They do that because according to the law, any accident property will need to be sold at a lesser than the market price. But if someone sleeps/lives in there for a while, it will not be considered an accident property anymore, and people can sell it at a normal price after that. The person who lives in the accident properties is called 洗屋師 (araiyashi); it is not an official job.
